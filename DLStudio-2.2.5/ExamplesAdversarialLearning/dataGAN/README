This README contains info regarding the dataset you need for running the scripts on
adversarial learning for data modeling.

Dataset:

  1.   PurdueShapes5GAN

           PurdueShapes5GAN-20000.gz

This dataset is needed for running the scripts in the ExamplesAdversarialNetworks
directory.  The number '20000' in the name of the dataset archive means that it
consists of 20,000 images.

This dataset was designed for giving classroom demonstrations of adversarial learning
for data modeling.

The images in the dataset are of size 64x64.  Each image has a random number (up to
five) of the objects drawn from the following five shapes: rectangle, triangle, disk,
oval, and star.  Each shape is randomized with respect to all its parameters,
including those for its scale and location in the image. Even the choice of color for
each object is assigned randomly.

======================================================================================

After you have unpacked the top-level data archive file 

       datasets_for_AdversarialNetworks.tar.gz
by 
       tar zxvf datasets_for_AdversarialNetworks.tar.gz

in the ExamplesAdversarialNetworks directory of the distribution, you will see
the following dataset directory

       dataGAN

Now do

       cd dataGAN
      
and you will see in this directory an archive named 

      PurdueShapes5GAN-20000.tar.gz

Now do the following

      tar zxvf PurdueShapes5GAN-20000.tar.gz
